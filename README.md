# CQL Tests Results Repository

This repository supports posting the results of running the [CQL Tests](https://github.com/cqframework/cql-tests) against a CQL engine.

This repository has a [results](results) folder that is the target, and that is expected to contain any number of JSON files that are formatted as defined by the [CQL-Tests-Runner](https://github.com/cqframework/cql-tests-runner) as documented in the [Result](https://github.com/cqframework/cql-tests-runner/blob/main/cql-tests-runner.js#L53) class.
